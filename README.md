# Basic_stats

learnr tutorials on:

* The basics of statistical testing
* t-tests
* chi-square tests
* correlation analysis


These are a series of tutorials written in learnr to teach undergraduates basic hypothesis testing. I'm making these available for anyone who wants to use them. They can be compiled easily into an R package in RStudio which means that, if a recent release of RStudio is used, they will appear in the "tutorials" pane when the package is loaded.
